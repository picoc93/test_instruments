# pyFY3200S

This is a python library for interfacing wiht the FY3200S arbitrary function signal generator.

It is currently very, very hacky and rough. See test.py for example and test code.

## Requirements

* An FY3200S function generator ;)
* [pySerial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial)

This has only been tested on Linux. It was written assuming python 3, but will probably work with 2 with some minor hackery.
